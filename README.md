# FrontEnd
A simple jQuery frontend to demo microservices functionality

The front-end is a jQuery-based JavaScript application that exposed to customers. It communicates with underlying backend service via RESTful interface. 

The backend is Node.js application, which works as a gateway for the front-end to communicate to microservices. 

The microservices architecture consists of 4 microservices:
1. Authentication Server
2. Cart Server
3. Address Server
4. Catalog Server

Microservices communicates with web backend application using REST protocol.
